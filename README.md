# Copper First!
### A vanilla datapack that prevents the **stone -> iron** progression
**Why?** I see a lot of mods that add copper tools and armor, yet no actual reason to use them instead of good old iron. This datapack forces copper into the progression to solve this issue.

**NOTE:** This datapack is not meant to function on its own. It is meant to be added **on top of** a modpack that adds copper tools. If you simply use this datapack on a vanilla world, iron will be a lot more annoying to get.
